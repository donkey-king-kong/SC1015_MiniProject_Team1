## ❓About / Problem Statement
Problem Statement  
In today's interconnected world, social media have become central to our communication and our means of self-expression. However, this also gives rise to cyberbullying which can affect individuals mental health and well-being. Our motivation is to cultivate a safer online environment.

Aim: Detect & classify offensive or abusive language in tweets as cyberbullying using machine learning algorithms

Objective:  
🟢 Build a cyberbullying tweet detection model capable of identifying cyberbullying tweets  
🟢 Classify tweets based on demographic attributes such as age, etc to enhance detection  
🟢 Gain insights on the demographics that is most affected by online harrassment  
🟢 Optimize our model by employing machine learning algorithms to train & fine-tune our model  

Possibilities that this insights can be beneficial for:  
🟢 Protecting individuals mental health and well-being on social media  
🟢 Aiding social media platorms in implementing and upholding their community standards with regards to cyberbullying  

## Datasets
Our dataset is taken from Kaggle: [Detecting bullying tweets 🤬 | PyTorch LSTM & BERT 🤖](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ludovicocuoghi/detecting-bullying-tweets-pytorch-lstm-bert)
